# restaurant-page
An interactive restaurant webpage built with JavaScript and Webpack. 

## Steps
1. Firstly we set up the project with checking our gitignore file to ignore files like node_modules and dist.
2. We will then install Webpack locally inside our directory, using the appropriate developer dependency flag "--save-dev".
3. We need to configure our webpack.config.js file in our root directory.
4. We make a src directory for our source files (HTML, CSS , JavaScript) which will contain our source code.
5. Inside our src directory we create a template.html file which will be our template HTML.
6. We are also adding an index.js file in our src directory with our JS inside.
