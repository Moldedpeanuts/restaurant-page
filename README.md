# restaurant-page
An interactive restaurant webpage built with JavaScript and Webpack. 

## Steps
1. Firstly we set up the project with checking our gitignore file to ignore files like node_modules and dist.
2. We will then install Webpack locally inside our directory, using the appropriate developer dependency flag "--save-dev".
